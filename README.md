# My Fragment

An interactive art installation displayed at [NANJO HOUSE 夏祭り in 美学校 2014](http://bigakko.jp/event/2014/014). A collaboration with [Kai Goto](http://kaigoto.com/).

This installation displays a real-time video feed from a Kinect camera where the user's body is replaced with a visualization of Kai Goto's "Fragment" artwork, rendered in WebGL. Upon pressing a button, a frame is captured and two copies of the image are printed, one for the user to take home and another to display at the exhibition.
